# React Pokédex 

### This time we updgrade the project of the pokédex, but instead of a practice of CSS it's one of React.js, we use the modularity of React and Axios for making a beautiful web app but keeping the functionality of the predecesor website, we use the pokeAPI for fetching the data and hold of another kind of data for showing a more modern Pokédex.

### You can clone it, run the command npm install for installing the dependencies, and once that done run npm start. (You should have already install Node.js)
